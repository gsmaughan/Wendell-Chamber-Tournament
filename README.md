# Wendell-Chamber-Tournament
An interactive website for tournament entry.

This app allows teams to sign-up for the Wendell Chamber of Commerce Golf Tournament.  I used Firebase to store all teams.  If you console.log, you will see each team that has signed up, as well as a running total of predicted revenue generated based upon which level of sponsorship selected.

The amount of predicted revenue generated was very useful in the days leading up to the golf tournament.  We used this tool to calculate projected profit, and to determine if we could afford to pay an extra employee that day.  It was also useful in predicting the funds raised for local charities.
